Introduction
============

Django-openzoom is a django application for displaying an image you can zoom in. It is based on the flash panorama viewer `OpenZoom <http://www.openzoom.org/>`_ from Daniel Gasienica.
All the necessary flash files are embedded whithin the application as static files.

Before you can use the application, you must fill a directory tree with images respecting the `DeepZoom <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom>`_ format .
In the open source world, you can use `Python Deep Zoom Tools <https://github.com/openzoom/deepzoom.py>`_ for that task. It converts an image file into lots of image tiles.

Installing the application
==========================

The OpenZoom application does not require any other application to be installed.

* insert the saladoplayer application in the INSTALLED_APPS tuple in your project settings.py::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    openzoom,
    ...
    )

* insert the openzoom.contextprocessor.settings in the TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS tuple in your project settings.py::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    ...
    openzoom.context_processor.settings,
    ...
    )

* modify the following symbols in settings.py:

    * OPENZOOM_FLASH_SECURE.This is a boolean value. It controls whether to use "alway" or "sameDomain" for the AllowScriptAccess parameter (see `Control access to scripts \| Host web page <http://helpx.adobe.com/flash/kb/control-access-scripts-host-web.html>`_ page from Adobe for some more explanations about this). When the value is True, "sameDomain" is used.
    * OPENZOOM_STATIC_URL. This is a string value. Its value is the panorama url root.

Using the templates
===================

You can use the following templates tags for including them in your own templates :

* before using the templates, insert this in your html page::

    {% load openzoom %}

* **openzoomscript**. This template tag must inserted in the header part of the html page. Its arguments are as follows :

    * **directory**. This is a string argument. This is the tour id of the tour to be displayed.
    * **Height**. This is an integer argument. This is the height of the
SaladoPlayer window.
    * **Width**. This is an integer argument. This is the width of the SaladoPlayer window::

        {% openzoomscript directory name height width %}

    This is how the path is organized : OPENZOOM_STATIC_URL/<directory>/<name>.xml

* **openzoomdiv** : There is no argument. This template tag must inserted in the body part of the html page where you want the image to appear. It inserts a div html tag which id is "OpenZoom"::

    {% openzoomdiv %}

Tips
====

Here are some tips and common mistakes.

When working with a remote host :

* Don't forget to collect static files. Then upload these files in a directory so that they can be served by a dedicated server. Read the official documentation about static files ;

* If you have installed the packages as eggs directories, don't forget to add ``django.template.loaders.eggs.Loader`` to your ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS`` tuple in your settings ;
